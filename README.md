**JavaScript Design Patterns**
========================================

A comprehensive collection of JavaScript design patterns and SOLID principle connections.
This repository serves as a learning reference to Frontend Engineers.

**üìñ Overview**
---------------

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software problems. They allow you to:

-   Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code

-   Reduce code duplication and complexity

-   Communicate with other developers using a shared vocabulary

-   Follow SOLID and Clean Architecture principles

This repo includes:

-   Classic JavaScript Patterns

-   Memory Tricks for Recognition

-   SOLID Connections


**üè∑Ô∏è Categories of Design Patterns**
-------------------------------------

Design patterns are typically divided into **three main types**:

| **Type** | **Purpose** | **Example Patterns** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Creational** | How objects are **created** | Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype |
| **Structural** | How objects are **organized/connected** | Adapter, Facade, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Proxy |
| **Behavioral** | How objects **communicate/behave** | Observer, State, Strategy, Chain of Responsibility, Iterator, Visitor, Template Method, Memento |
